# Tarsier Space Technology

* 2015-0509: 4.7 (JPLRepo) for KSP 1.0.
	+ Added KAS and KIS support for the small HDD(SDD) - Requires Module Manager to be installed.
	+ Can now STORE science data into SDDs via EVA. Reminder Warning: Storing and removing science data from SDDs lose some science value each time (data corruption feature).
	+ Drive Capacity for SDDs upped to 120mits (about 4 pictures) and 480mits (about 16 pictures).
	+ Re-balance max temperatures of parts.
	+ The Small Telescope now only returns 80% of max science value for pictures of planetoids and 50% of max science value for pictures of galaxies. The Large Telescope returns Full science value.
	+ Added Science descriptions for the Galaxies.
	+ Added lab boost to Science gathered - science can now be boosted in the Mobile Lab.
	+ Added KSP-AVC support.
	+ Converted all PNGs to DDS files now supported in KSP 1.0.x.
* 2015-0502: 4.6 (JPLRepo) for KSP 1.0.0
	+ Compat. with KSP V1.0.0
	+ Rebalanced all parts costs and to new Tech Tree.
	+ nerfed Small telescope range.
	+ Fixes for contract spamming and you now need the Large telescope Tech for the Galaxy contracts.
* 2015-0213: 2.5 (JPLRepo) for KSP 0.7.3
	+ Fixes for 0.90
	+ Fixed to integrate with Autopilot correctly.
	+ Fixed for contracts and galaxies to work correctly.
